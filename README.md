# Hey! 👋

I'm Lucas!, a brazillian programmer, currently stuck at home.

## Interests! ✌
I'm usually doing applications with Rust, C, Nodejs or Flutter.
And my interests revolve around graphical programming, maths and networks.
## Doing? 📋
Most of the time I am studying from home for my bachelor's degree in the Information Systems course.

But I also take some time to more stuff like:
- OpenGL aplications 
- p5js programming
- simple bots with nodejs
- stb like libs
- fighting against rust borrow checker
